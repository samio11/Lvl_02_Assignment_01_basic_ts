The Significance of Union and Intersection Types in TypeScript
TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript, introduces several advanced features to make code more predictable and maintainable. Two of these key features are union and intersection types. Understanding them is essential for writing flexible, yet type-safe code.

1. Union Types
Union types allow a variable or function parameter to hold multiple possible types. This is useful when a value can be more than one type, and you want to handle each case separately.

Example:

typescript
Copy code
let id: number | string;
id = 123;  // valid
id = "abc"; // also valid
In the example above, id can be either a number or a string. Union types help make code more flexible while maintaining type safety, enabling developers to handle various cases explicitly.

Use Case: Union types are often used when a function accepts multiple types of input and processes each differently. For example, handling events that could have either MouseEvent or KeyboardEvent inputs.

2. Intersection Types
Intersection types combine multiple types into one, ensuring that a value satisfies all the types involved. This is useful when an object must have properties or behaviors from multiple types.

Example:

typescript
Copy code
type Person = { name: string };
type Employee = { employeeId: number };

let employee: Person & Employee = {
  name: "John",
  employeeId: 123
};
Here, the employee must satisfy both Person and Employee types, meaning it must have both name and employeeId properties. Intersection types are perfect for composing multiple types into one without losing any information.

Use Case: Intersection types are typically used when combining different interfaces or types, such as when defining complex objects that need multiple characteristics.

3. Why Are They Significant?
Union types provide flexibility by allowing a variable to be more than one type, making code adaptable to different scenarios.
Intersection types ensure type safety and precision, guaranteeing that a variable satisfies multiple type contracts.
By using union and intersection types, TypeScript strikes a balance between flexibility and type safety, allowing developers to write clean, maintainable code while handling complex type scenarios effortlessly.
